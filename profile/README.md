From the creator of [`brew`], tea is a standalone, binary download for all
platforms that puts the entire open
source ecosystem at your fingertips. Casually and effortlessly use the latest
and greatest or the oldest and most mature from any layer of any stack. Break
down the silos between programming communities, throw together scripts that
use entirely separate tools and languages and share them with the world with
a simple one-liner.

All you need is `tea`.

## Our Manifesto

* To create incredible tooling: the base of every developer’s stack
* To cater to our users, not ourselves
* To take open source to the next level by funding the unpaid maintainers who
    thanklessly create the stack that powers the Internet
